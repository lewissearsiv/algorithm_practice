**This is a Training Repository** 

This is a practice repository created on December 18th, 2020 where I write algorithms from scratch and then practice using them. The motivation of this repository is to practice building theoretical intuition for common statistical models after the completion of Metis's Fall 2020 Data Science Bootcamp. The goal is to keep my programming skills sharp while reviewing for potential interview questions. This is a fluid list of some such algorithms:

**Classification**
1. K-nearest neighbors
2. Logistic Regression
3. Naive Bayes
