**Repository Outline** 

This is a practice repository created on December 18th, 2020 where I write algorithms from scratch and then practice using them. It will be updated sporatically as I have free time to push meaningful work. Each algorithm has its own folder. Inside, there should be an instructive walkthrough of the construction, a *.py* file containing the main algorithm, and a few examples.

The motivation of this repository is to practice building theoretical intuition for common statistical models after the completion of Metis's Fall 2020 Data Science Bootcamp. The goal is to keep my programming skills sharp while reviewing for potential interview questions. This is a fluid list of some such algorithms:

**Regression**
1. Linear Regression with Regularization - FINISHED

**Classification**
1. K-nearest neighbors - FINISHED
2. Naive Bayes - FINISHED

**Clustering**
1. K-means - FINISHED

**Neural Networks**
1. Multilayer Perceptron - (In Progress)
