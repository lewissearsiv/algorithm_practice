    "## DBSCAN Clustering\n",
    "#### Lewis Sears\n",
    "\n",
    "**Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise**, commonly DBSCAN, is a popular unsupervised clustering technique that is fundamentally different than $k$-means clustering. Instead of iteratively creating centroids estimating the centers of our desired centroids, DBSCAN creates $\\epsilon$ neighborhoods around each data point and analyzes the crossover of the points. We label these points as *core* and *boundary* points based on how many other data points are in the neighborhood. Points with no other points in their neighborhood are considered *noise* points. There are naturally two hyperparameters to the algorithm:\n",
    "1. How large do we make $\\epsilon$ to accurately capture the topology of clusters without capturing noise?\n",
    "2. For a data point $x_{i}$ with an neighborhood $N_{\\epsilon}(x_{i})$, how many other data points must be in $N_{\\epsilon}(x_{i})$ to label $x_{i}$ as a core point of the cluster? \n",
    "This naturally requires some intensive tuning."
